It's of course also possible to contribute with a "traditional" local development environment (see below).

Community
=========

If you are interested in contributing to this project, but perhaps don't quite know how and where to get started, please [join our developer mailing list](http://fineract.apache.org/#contribute), listen into our conversations, chime into threads, and just send us a friendly "Hello!" introduction email; we're a friendly bunch, and look forward to hearing from you.


Requirements
============
* Java >= 1.8 (Oracle JVMs have been tested)
* MySQL 5.5

You can run the required version of the database server in a container, instead of having to install it, like this:

    docker run --name mysql-5.5 -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql -d mysql:5.5

and stop and destroy it like this:

    docker rm -f mysql-5.5

Beware that this database container database keeps its state inside the container and not on the host filesystem.  It is lost when you destroy (rm) this container.  This is typically fine for development.  See [Caveats: Where to Store Data on the database container documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) re. how to make it persistent instead of ephemeral.


Instructions how to run for local development
============

Run the following commands:
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_tenants`
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_default`
1. `./gradlew tomcatRunWAR`


Instructions to download gradle wrapper
============
The file fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar binary is checked into this projects Git source repository,
but won't exist in your copy of the Fineract codebase if you downloaded a released source archive from apache.org.
In that case, you need to download it using the commands below:

    wget --no-check-certificate -P fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper https://github.com/apache/fineract/raw/develop/fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar

(or)

    curl --insecure -L https://github.com/apache/fineract/raw/develop/fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar > fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar


Instructions to run Apache RAT (Release Audit Tool)
============
1. Extract the archive file to your local directory.
2. Run `./gradlew rat`. A report will be generated under build/reports/rat/rat-report.txt


Instructions to build a WAR file
============
1. Extract the archive file to your local directory.
2. Run `./gradlew clean war` or `./gradlew build` to build a deployable war file which will be created at build/libs directory.


Instructions to execute Integration tests
============
> Note that if this is the first time to access MySQL DB, then you may need to reset your password.

Run the following commands, very similarly to how [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) does:
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_tenants`
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_default`
1. `./gradlew clean integrationTest`


Instructions to run using Docker and docker-compose
===================================================

It is possible to do a 'one-touch' installation of Fineract using containers (AKA "Docker").

As Prerequisites, you must have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your machine; see
[Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and
[Docker Compose Install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Alternatively, you can also use [Podman](https://github.com/containers/libpod)
(e.g. via `dnf install podman-docker`), and [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose/)
(e.g. via `pip3 install podman-compose`) instead of Docker.

Now to run a new Fineract instance you can simply:

1. `git clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git ; cd fineract`
1. `docker-compose build`
1. `docker-compose up -d`
1. Fineract will run at https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider now!

The [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) will build the `fineract` container from the source based on the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile).

https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/fineract has a pre-built container of this project, built continuously.

You must specify the MySQL tenants database JDBC URL by passing it to the `fineract` container via environment
variables; please consult the [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) for exact details how to specify those.
_(Note that in previous versions, the `mysqlserver` environment variable used at `docker build` time instead of at
`docker run` time did something similar; this has changed in [FINERACT-773](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-773)),
and the `mysqlserver` environment variable is now no longer supported.)_


Instructions to run on Kubernetes
=================================

General Clusters
----------------

You can also run Fineract using containers on a Kubernetes cluster.
Make sure you set up and connect to your Kubernetes cluster.
You can follow [this](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Install+and+configure+kubectl+and+Google+Cloud+SDK+on+ubuntu+16.04) guide to set up a Kubernetes cluster on GKE. Make sure to replace `apache-fineract-cn` with `apache-fineract`

Now e.g. from your Google Cloud shell, run the following commands:

1. `git clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git ; cd fineract/kubernetes`
1. `./kubectl-startup`

To shutdown and reset your Cluster, run:

    ./kubectl-shutdown

Using Minikube
--------------

Alternatively, you can run fineract on a local kubernetes cluster using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).
As Prerequisites, you must have `minikube` and `kubectl` installed on your machine; see
[Minikube & Kubectl install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

Now to run a new Fineract instance on Minikube you can simply:

1. `git clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git ; cd fineract/kubernetes`
1. `minikube start`
1. `./kubectl-startup.sh`
1. `minikube service fineract-server --url --https`
1. Fineract is now running at the printed URL (note HTTP), which you can check e.g. using:

    http --verify=no --timeout 240 --check-status get $(minikube service fineract-server --url --https)/fineract-provider/actuator/health

To check the status of your containers on your local minikube Kubernetes cluster, run:

    minikube dashboard

You can check Fineract logs using:

    kubectl logs deployment/fineract-server

To shutdown and reset your cluster, run:

    ./kubectl-shutdown

We have [some open issues in JIRA with Kubernetes related enhancement ideas](https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-783?jql=labels%20%3D%20kubernetes%20AND%20project%20%3D%20%22Apache%20Fineract%22%20) which you are welcome to contribute to.


Checkstyle
============

This project enforces its code conventions using [checkstyle.xml](fineract-provider/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml).  It is configured to run automatically during the normal Gradle build, and fail if there are any style violations detected.
We recommend that you configure your favourite Java IDE to match those conventions.  For Eclipse, you can
File > Import > General > Preferences our [config/fineractdev-eclipse-preferences.epf](config/fineractdev-eclipse-preferences.epf).
You could also use Checkstyle directly in your IDE (but you don't neccesarily have to, it may just be more convenient for you).  For Eclipse, use https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/ and load our checkstyle.xml into it, for IntelliJ you can use [CheckStyle-IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065-checkstyle-idea).

Code Coverage Reports
============

The project uses Jacoco to measure unit tests code coverage, to generate a report run the following command:

    `./gradlew clean build jacocoTestReport`

Generated reports can be found in build/code-coverage directory.
